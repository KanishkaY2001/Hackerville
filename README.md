# Hackerville
**Hackerville**, was a concept game, starting as a project which focused on drone-vs-drone combat, and evolved into an idea involving cyberpunk-esque guns, melee weapons, armor and accessories. Although this game is incomplete, the drone combat  for 'Dreadnought', the attack-mode drone, has been fully programmed and can be tested on the game.
